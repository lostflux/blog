        Hello, my name is Altair, a current undergraduate student
        at Dartmouth College. I am passionate about data and computation,
        hence my dual major in Mathematics and Computer Science.
        I am seeking internship roles in Machine Learning.
        What else do you need to know?
        <br>
        It gives Azure users a single platform for Big Data processing and 
        Machine Learning.

        Fast-forward to today, and Iâ€™ve had the privilege of working at
        <a href="https://us.mullenlowe.com/">an advertising agency</a>,
        <a href="https://starry.com/">a start-up</a>,
        <a href="https://www.apple.com/">a huge corporation</a>, and
        <a href="https://scout.camd.northeastern.edu/">a student-led design studio</a>. My
        main focus these days is building accessible, inclusive products and digital
        experiences at <a href="https://upstatement.com/">Upstatement</a> for a variety of
        clients.
