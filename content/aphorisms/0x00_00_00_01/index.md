For a long time I considered myself a slow thinker.
I felt I wasn't particularly good at thinking on the spot
and articulating what I wanted to express
&mdash; probably one of the reasons I meet any semblance of
an intellectual interview with such trepidation.
But I recently came across [Derek Sivers' post][sivers] and found it so relatable:

> When someone asks me a deep question, I say,
>
> _"Hmm. I don’t know."_
>
> The next day, I have an answer.
> I’m a disappointing person to try to debate or attack.
> I just have nothing to say in the moment, except maybe, _"**That's crazy**"_ or _"**Good point**."_
> Then a few days later, after thinking about it a lot, I have a response.

I'm far more confident in expressing thoughts in text form, but even then,
it's rarely an immediate back and forth conversation.
I might need several minutes to formulate a response.
That's not really applicable in person;
you can't exactly sit and stare at someone blankly for $60$ seconds
while the cogs are turning to gather your thoughts.
Live conversations don't work that way. There's no pause button to go and double check a reference to avoid a fuck up. We never like sounding stupid or misinformed. And you can't prepare for every conversation you have.

People say that your first reaction is the most honest, but I disagree.
Your first reaction is usually outdated;
either it’s an answer you came up with long ago and now use instead of thinking,
or it’s a knee-jerk emotional response to something in your past.

How slowly or quickly one thinks is not an accurate measurement of their intelligence.
Slow thinking can be more intentioned and less erratic.
Yet, even with this in mind, one sometimes falls into the trap
of verbosely answering a question that they later regret
when they should have simply pushed it to one side until they were ready.
