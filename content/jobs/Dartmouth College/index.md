- Supported students learning what most found their most challenging
  concepts yet: the mechanics of low-level programming.
- The course covers, among other things, the C programming language,
  Linux virtual machines, Bash scripting, source control (Git),
  build systems (Make), and debugging tools (GDB, valgrind).
- Beyond helping students debug their code,
  I also graded bi-weekly projects and gave **constructive** feedback
  to students.
