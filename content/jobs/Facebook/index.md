- Prototyped new infrastructure for Meta's machine learning platform.
- Designed and developed a utility to aid Meta engineers in testing
  ML models by ingesting data from hyper-active pipelines
  from the Meta family of apps (Instagram, Facebook, etc.)
  and redirecting it onto a controlled-rate pipeline.
- Designed and implemented multiple extensions, including
  multi-threading and asynchronous computation to bolster
  the supported data rates.
- At completion, the util could generates loads of up-to 375k
  data-points per second.
