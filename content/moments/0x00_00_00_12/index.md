We often underestimate the stories that live in our hearts.
Stories that square our truth to feelings unchanged by time.
We may reject them in fear of their pain
&mdash; denying, rather than holding, and concealing, rather than revealing &mdash;
hoping that they fade or vanish entirely.
But such artifacts do not easily faint;
instead, they grow in perpetual search for a shadow to call home.

  They persist.  
  Unadmitted and undirected.  
  Insistent, yet lost.
