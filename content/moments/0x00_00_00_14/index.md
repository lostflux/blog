What is darkness, but an excuse for light?

Without darkness, would the stars be admired?  
Without burn, would hominids discover fire?  
Without a shadow, could you find a light source?  
Without hunger, could you muster a course?

What is dark, but an excuse for light?  
What is death, but an excuse for life?

What is rot, but an excuse for ripe?
