I sometimes think about the inner workings of who I am and the transparency of my truth,
the regressions and progressions I've learned to grow within and from,
the ever changing ebb and flow of the experiences I've had and I'm yet to have.
I'm grateful that I have taken in so much by naturally being an observer,
but it all feels so overwhelming, especially lately.

I haven't felt inspired in a long while, and perhaps it's because I've been doing the work
mentally and haven't found a breakthrough moment to transform it into the physical world yet.
Maybe I don't know how to, maybe I'm afraid to, or maybe I'm just lazy.
I'm at a stage where I don't feel like the human part of me
feels seen and if so, it is too much for others to take in.
Yet, the vulnerability in which I find myself is where I feel the most alive,
and I'm starting to realize that maybe that deters people from wanting to stay.
Staying to look a little closer. To look a little longer. Dive a little deeper.

I wonder if my work has reached its peak and I'm meant to refocus my energy elsewhere.
I never truly know what my purpose is but all I know is that my curiosity in learning
more about my mental landscape and others will allow me to get closer to
the finding that will enrich my life. It's not about the numbers and however much
more you can tack onto your ego &mdash; it's about finding what will truly
shape you at the core and receiving it unconditionally.

A reminder to take a closer look at the people whose work you admire and
embrace the humanness that precedes their craft.
Maybe you'll find that there is a part of you in others that you haven't given
yourself a chance to discover.
