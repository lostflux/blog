A common problem in robotics is localizing a robot in a novel environment
given sensor readings. This project uses <highlight> hidden markov models </highlight>
&mdash; the <highlight> forward-backward </highlight> algorithms and the <highlight> viterbi </highlight> algorithm &mdash;
to decipher where a robot _most likely_ is in
a maze given its immediate readings and what we know regarding
the environment. Emissions due to <highlight> sensor inaccuracies are also factored in </highlight>.
