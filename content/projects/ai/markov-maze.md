A common problem in robotics is localizing a robot in an environment
given sensor readings. This project uses hidden markov models,
the forward-backward algorithm, and the viterbi algorithm
to decipher where a robot _most likely_ is in
a maze given its immediate readings and what we know re. its sensor accuracies.
