A bot that uses **_hidden markov models_** to tag parts of speech in a sentence.
We use the **_viterbi algorithm_** to generate a sequence of tags for the sentence
keeping in mind the
<span style="color: yellow"> tag probabilities </span> for each word and the
<span style="color: yellow"> transition probabilities </span> between tags.
