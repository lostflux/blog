A bot that uses <highlight> hidden markov models </highlight> to tag parts of speech in a sentence.
We use the <highlight> viterbi algorithm </highlight> to <highlight> generate a sequence of tags </highlight>
for the sentence keeping in mind the
<highlight> tag probabilities for each word </highlight> and the
<highlight> transition probabilities between tags </highlight>.
