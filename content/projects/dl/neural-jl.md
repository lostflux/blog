As part of a <highlight> publication
exploring the emergence and the state of the art
in machine learning</highlight> and most-importantly
<highlight> the utilities and caveats </highlight>
that machine learning afford us,
I implemented <highlight> neural networks </highlight> to demonstrate
how predictions work in the context of simple classification
and regression problems.
