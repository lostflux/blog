A fully functional relational <highlight> database app </highlight> app built with a
[Python](https://www.python.org/) frontend
and a [MySQL](https://www.mysql.com/) backend.
It is modeled for a collective of publishing houses
and offers data stores and a command-line interface
for querying and analyzing the data.
It offers support for <highlight> different user modes </highlight>
(_author_, _editor_, _reviewer_),
and each user can opt into <highlight> password authentication </highlight>.
Several <highlight> automated events are handled internally </highlight> &mdash;
for instance, assigning and re-assigning editors and reviewers,
auto-rejecting submissions that are not within the relevant scope,
and accepting OR rejecting publications once all reviews are in.
