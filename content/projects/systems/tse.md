A hyper-efficient search engine that crawls webpages (whose domain can be restricted
to a given rule) and indexes them then permits the user to query the collection
of pages. For each query, the search engine prints a list of matching pages
ranked by frequency.
The search engine also supports the use of _AND_, _OR_, and _NOT_ operators
to refine the search.
